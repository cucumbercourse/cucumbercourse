# Cucumber Essentials
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Cucumber Essentials`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Course Description

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

Navigate to the linkedinlearning.cucumbercourse folder and run "mvn test" to execute the test cases.

The restaurant_calculator folder contains a simple Python Django calculator web application. If you want to run this application, open a new shell session and navigater to the restaurant_calculator folder. Then run "python manage.py runserver" to start the web application. The application will be available at port 8000.

## Branches
1. Branches are named after chapters. 
2. The branch CH02After contains all code built during chapter 2. 
3. This course helps build code incrementally, often starting with the code written in the previous chapter(s). The branch named CH02After is effectively the same as "CH03Before" even though there is no branch named CH03Before. So CH03After is the same as "CH04Before" and so on.
4. You can start with main, which contains code at the beginning of the course and build code incrementally. Or start with a specific branch to get all code built in that chapter.
5. Chapter 1 has no coding lessons.
